*Dear Instagram, Good Bye and Good Riddance.*

In comparison to an analogue sketchbook there really is no real digital equivalent to me. We live in an age of mass consumption. But are we really *consuming* anything? To me the systematic pull-to-refresh and aimlessly scrolling a feed feels more like chewing and then spitting out—a reflex, a mindless habit. To actually consume you also need to digest. The likes of Instagram, Facebook and Twitter et al leave me cold and numb.

There is simply too much stimulation to take any of it in properly. I started using Instagram as a way to file away my sketches as I produced them. Looking back on them now, there is no story there, no progression. I also don’t remember the last time I went through someone’s whole Instagram like I would sitting with their sketchbook. Instead I go through a mishmash of loads of peoples work that I may like but it is out of context and does not get the full attention that it deserves. I feel like a zombie and with time I have begun to hate the process.

I still want a place to share my sketches and any thoughts that go along with them. A blog format seems a better way to do that. Whether other people appreciate my take on the world remains to be seen, but I *need* to output my thoughts somewhere.
